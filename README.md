## Features  

*** 

This project takes in new notes from the user, saves the the data via POST requests. The data is saved as a json file in the server. Also the page is refreshed by fetching the data back via GET request. Tasks can be viewed and deleted. New notes can always be added.

### Challenges encountered  
This project was a great way to practice creating a server back-end to keep persistent information for the user. Notes saved to this note taker program are saved server-side and can be recalled any time. The challenge here was in passing data back and forth from the front-end html/javascript to the server and serving data back.
